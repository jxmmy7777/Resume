## Projects
1. Age Prediction with Blurry Image by Deep Learning

   * **Objective**: Tackle the low-quaility image rocognition problem in CCTVs
   * **Introduction**: Team final project from programming design course in Electrical Engineering department.
     We design a novel VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network model. Gaussian algorithm and Medain algorithm are 
     applied to stimulate blurry images. We used linear regression method to optimized the prediction. It is 
     our prelimanary result due to imbalanced data distrubution.
  
  
2. Rope climbing robot

   *	**Objective**: Design a robot with rope climbing ability to overcome abstacles
   * **Introduction**: It is our final project from Mechanical Design course. Solidworks and Autocad are used 
   to design the robot.The robot is made up of 3D printing and laser cutting t. We use Arduino and PS2 module
   to control the robot to achieve rope climbing task.



3. Mechanism analysis project

   * **Objective**: Analysing crank slider mechanism of car and crank rocker mechanism of bicycle
   * **Introduction**: We use python to caculate the maximum acceleration, speed and its corresponding angle.



4. Mechanical Blood Clot Retriever 

   * **Objective**: Our main purpose is to deal with Acute Ischemic Stroke, 
     which occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked by blood clot
  
   * **Introduction**: We innovated an irregular surface shape to effectively take out thrombus. The design so 
     far are mostly come from stents. In this project, the Novel Blood Clot Retriever aims to designing a 
     retriever specially for retrieving blood clot. The special scalelike appearance can increase surface 
     roughness to improve blood clot retrieving percentage.
